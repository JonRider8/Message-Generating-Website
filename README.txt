Message Generating Website
==========================

What does this program do
-------------------------

1. Running the program will display a random message that appears on the website
2. Each time the user refreshes the page the website should show a new message

## Why build this program?

1. This is a milestone project for myself to see if I can create a full stack project
2. Project should be expandable :chart_with_upwards_trend: :
  * Currently the project will be a simple, some HTML, CSS, and JS.
  * Add user interactivity
  * Add a like in the future
  * Add a share quote button that copies the quote the clipboard :clipboard:
  * Add a share creator button that links to my GitHub or LinkedIn or Portfolio website
  * Maybe adding links to other GitHub project in the footer of the page
